PubNubDemo
==========

Simple demo using the PubNub Real-Time network in a Xamarin iOS app.

To get it working: create a trial account at http://pubnub.com, and 
copy the Publish and Subscribe keys to this section in the PubNubDemoViewController.cs file:

		const string CHANNELNAME = " YOUR CHANNEL NAME HERE ";
		const string PUBLISH_KEY = " YOUR PUBLISH KEY HERE ";
		const string SUBSCRIBE_KEY = " YOUR SUBSCRIBE KEY HERE ";
    
You can think of a channel name yourself.
